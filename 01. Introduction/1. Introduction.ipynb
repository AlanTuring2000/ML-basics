Specifically, we are interested in a particular value (or a particular class), say \"y\", and we have a dataset of examples where the value of \"y\" is known, along with a set of other values. Although we do not initially know whether these other values are strongly related or unrelated to \"y\", we hope to find a relation that will enable us to determine the value of \"y\" given these other values. The term \"supervised\" refers to the training examples (data inputs) for which the desired output signals (or classes, also called labels) \"y\" are already known. Supervised learning, therefore, consists in modeling the relationship between the data inputs and the labels.</p>$\\quad$\n",

Since the information about the current state of the environment typically also includes a so-called \"<font color='darkpink'>reward signal</font>\", we can think of reinforcement learning as a field related to supervised learning. However, in reinforcement learning, this feedback is not the correct ground truth label or value, but a measure of how well the action was measured by a reward function.
